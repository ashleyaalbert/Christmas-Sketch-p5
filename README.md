3rd Skill Video for CSCI 201

This p5 JavaSCript program is to help people get in the mood for Christmas and the season of giving!  The program includes a festive background, Santa getting a present if you use the slider to get it to him, the playing of Christmas music/sounds, and the beautiful sight of snow falling.

Instead of editing my Professor's program for this assignment, I wanted to display my creativity and the joy that Christmas brings me, so I created my own p5 JavScript program.  The snow fall effect used in this code is from the examples on the p5 reference page.  Every other element in this code was written by me from scratch and what I have learned in CSCI 187.  

This is my first time using GitHub! I am hopeful that I used it correctly.
